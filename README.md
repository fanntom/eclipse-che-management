A Python 3 based Eclipse Che Management Console I am working on.

# What is This?
This is a Python 3 based Eclipse Che Management Console that help you start and stop Eclipse Che.
Currently it only supports starting and stopping Eclipse Che in multi-user mode but I am planning to add more features.

# Notice
I have only tested this on Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS.
Support for other OSs is unknown so it might not work on other platforms.
