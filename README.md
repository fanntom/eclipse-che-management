A Python 3 based Eclipse Che Management Console I am working on.

# What is This?
This is a Python 3 based Eclipse Che Management Console that help you start and stop Eclipse Che.
Currently it only supports starting and stopping Eclipse Che in multi-user mode but I am planning to add more features.
